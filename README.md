The technology has been growing from day to day in human life. The necessity for
the development of technology is to lead human life comfortably. The basic need of
human to lead his/her life comfortably is a home. A home with updated latest
technology which means a smart home. This paper gives the basic idea use cisco
packet tracer to implement smart home. One is needed to create a smart home when
electronic devices are switched on and off. Smart home development is achieved by
simulation via testing system, network setup and wireless home gateway computer
network equipment required by a smart home network cisco packet tracer. The
software chosen for the simulations is Cisco Packet Tracer, the tool's main strength
is to offer a variety of network components that represent a real network, and then
interconnect and configure devices to create a network and add all the smart devices,
sensors and actuators
